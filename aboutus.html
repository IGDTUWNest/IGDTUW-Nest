          <p>
            <span class="intro-line">IGDTUW Nest is a space built by students ‚Äî for students ‚Äî to make your college life a little easier and a lot more real.</span>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We‚Äôve curated <strong>student-recommended PGs</strong> with honest details, so you don‚Äôt feel lost while house-hunting. 
            From <strong>the best food spots</strong> to cozy chai corners and campus chill scenes ‚Äî everything‚Äôs listed based on real experiences.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Since campus life can feel overwhelming at first, we‚Äôve also added resources created by seniors to guide you through.
            Whether it's <em>exploring Delhi in your breaks</em> or <em>finding answers when things feel confusing</em>, we‚Äôve tried to cover it all.
          </p>
      
          <p class="closing-line">
            IGDTUW Nest isn‚Äôt just a website. It‚Äôs a <strong>warm comfort space</strong>, something close to our hearts ‚Äî built to reflect what being an IGDTUW girl truly feels like. üíó

        <p>Hi! I'm Stuti Shukla, a 2nd-year student at IGDTUW, from the ECE with AI department and the co-founder of IGDTUW Nest.<br>
           I started this initiative with the hope of doing something creative and meaningful ‚Äî something that could make life a bit easier and more exciting for freshers.

          Even though I wasn't from a coding background, I wanted to explore and learn, and IGDTUW Nest became a small reflection of that journey. It‚Äôs filled with efforts, ideas, and love ‚Äî to help you navigate college life, find the right PG, and feel more connected to your new home.<br>
          
          I hope this space becomes a cozy corner for you ‚Äî just like it became for me while creating it. </p>
