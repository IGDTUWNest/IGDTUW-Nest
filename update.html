              Whatever sem you have Physics and Maths in, study them with full shiddat — you really don’t want a bad grade haunting you later. Be cautious on the metro; not everyone you’ll meet is kind. Don’t let the pressure of academics or placements burn you out.
              Try connecting with different people — you might just find your homies here. Work hard, stay grateful for every opportunity, and be responsive; it’ll show in your growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing you can’t miss: sit on the main ground during winter evenings with your friends, talking about everything and nothing. Finish your assignments — believe it or not, they’ll become sweet memories one day.
            </p>
            <p>
              And always keep a few cutie people close — their jokes and banter can make even the worst days bearable. 🫶🏻

              Stay sharp during classes or have someone reliable to fill you in — don’t stay clueless. Try your best not to miss lab sessions — they’re more important than they seem.
              You don’t need to be in every event, but showing up for the right ones can really make a difference. Stay connected with your seniors — both in your branch and outside.
            <p>
              Talk to everyone, but keep your close circle tight. When it comes to skill-building, explore different fields and find what truly vibes with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              And most importantly, have fun and enjoy the ride. Not everything will be in your control — but for the things that are, make them count.

              Hello freshers! You're about to begin an exciting new journey. Explore, enjoy, and grow — but also stay cautious. Don’t ignore your CGPA and focus on developing skills that set you apart. Join societies that interest you and work on your personality.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be happy days, but also tough moments — emotional breakdowns, setbacks, even heartbreaks. Stay strong, stay connected with your loved ones, and never isolate yourself. These challenges are part of your journey and will shape you into a stronger version of yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be clear about your goals, chase them, and by the end of these 4 years, you’ll see how far you’ve come. 🌸

              It can all feel overwhelming at first and that’s okay. Just remember, it’ll all be worth it.
              There will be moments where you feel lost or unsure, but trust the process. Stay aware of what's happening around you — both academically and co-curricular-wise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Explore fearlessly what you like, what you don’t. That’s how you grow.
              And please, don’t hesitate to ask questions or reach out to seniors — we’ve been in your shoes, and we get how it feels.

              After the whole JEE grind, your first year at IGDTUW will feel like a breath of fresh air and it truly is your golden year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make friends who feel like home, explore Delhi beyond the textbooks, join societies that excite you — build memories, not just a resume.
            </p>
            <p>
              But while you’re doing all that, don’t lose sight of your CGPA. Keeping it above 8 early on gives you the freedom to explore later without stress.
              Most of all, live your first year fully. This time won’t come back — so make it count. 🌸

              Start taking your CGPA seriously right from the first year. It plays a crucial role — whether it's internships, placements, or even unlocking future opportunities. Building that strong foundation early will save you a lot of stress later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t hesitate to participate in hackathons — even if you only know the basics. The exposure, the teamwork, and the learning experience are unmatched. It helps you build confidence and get noticed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go out with friends, explore the city, make memories — but stay focused too. Balance is key. IGDTUW has great placement records, so grab every opportunity you get — it truly pays off.

              Honestly, getting marks at IGDTUW isn’t that hard. One thing I seriously wish someone had told me earlier — most teachers care more about the **length** of your answers than the quality. Yep, you heard that right. The longer you write, the more it feels like you’ve worked hard. Even if you repeat or stretch a bit, it's okay. Just keep filling those pages — quantity is your golden ticket! 😂
            </p>
            <p>
              Trust me yaar, IGDTUW fests are something else. They're honestly better than NSUT, DTU, or IIIT fests — and I mean that. The vibe, the fun, the music — it's unforgettable. Don’t skip them over attendance or small work. Go all in and enjoy it with your whole heart. 💃🎉
            </p>
            <p>
              Placements are pretty great, but yeah, the campus is tiny — and sometimes even monkeys crash your lunch.

              I would like to give the following tips to my juniors:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Don’t mess up your midsem exams, they really do affect your CGPA.<br>
              2. Never underestimate CGPA. It’s not just about placements, it decides whether you can even sit for them.<br>
              3. Don’t waste time.Focus on learning new skills, it's super important.<br>  
              4. Don’t skip fests and college functions — enjoying the journey matters too.<br> 
              5. Keep exploring.Don’t just stick to one thing, discover what excites you.<br>
              6. Avoid joining too many societies at once — it can get messy and overwhelming.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, all the best for this beautiful new journey you're about to begin! 🌸

              For day scholars, finding seniors to guide you can be tough if you're not part of an active society. That’s why it’s important to put yourself out there — join groups, ask questions, and stay curious.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to academics or internships, try reaching out to 3rd-year and final-year students. From experience, second-years often don’t have full perspective yet — and that’s okay, but go where the insight is deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participate in hackathons early — even if you know absolutely nothing. It might feel like a waste of time or even a little embarrassing, but you’ll learn way more than you expect, and it will open doors later.
            </p>
            <p>
              And above all, the sooner you let go of the regret and pressure of the JEE phase, the freer and better this journey will feel. 🌱
